# Python Syntax Overview

## Introduction  
Syntax is essentially a set of rules that defines how code should be written, like a language’s grammar.  
In Python, the syntax is designed to be clean and easy to read, making it beginner-friendly.

## Python Code Structure  
- **Sequential Execution:**  
  Each line of code is executed in sequence, running from top to bottom. This helps make Python code both logical and straightforward.  

- **Indentation:**  
  Unlike other languages that use symbols to separate code blocks, Python uses **indentation**—spaces or tabs at the start of a line. This indentation makes the structure of the code clear and easy to follow.  

  **Example:**  
  ```python
  if True:
      print("This is indented and part of the if block.")



Syntax is essentially a set of rules that defines how code should be written, like a language’s grammar.

In Python, the syntax is designed to be clean and easy to read, making it beginner-friendly.

Each line of code is executed in sequence, running from top to bottom.

This structure helps make Python code both logical and straightforward.

Unlike other languages that use symbols to separate code blocks, Python uses indentation—meaning spaces or tabs at the start of a line.

For example, when we write a condition, the lines within that condition are indented, letting Python know they belong together.

This indentation makes the structure of the code clear and easy to follow.

Comments are notes added to the code that Python ignores when the program runs.

They start with a special symbol and are mainly used to explain what the code does.

Adding comments can be really helpful, both for others reading your code and as reminders for yourself.

The "print" function is used to display text or numbers on the screen.

It’s a simple way to show information, whether it’s a message, a result, or any other output you want the user to see.

Think of variables as containers that hold data values, like names or numbers.

You assign a value to a variable using an equals sign, which stores the data so you can use it later in your code.

These are the basic data types you’ll work with in your code.

A string is used for text, like a name or any other words.

An integer is a whole number, useful for counting or indexing.

And a float represents decimal numbers, which come in handy for more precise values like measurements.

SubtitleA variable name must start with a letter or an underscore.

You can also use numbers within the name but not at the start.

Also, be careful not to use Python keywords as variable names as that is not allowed.
